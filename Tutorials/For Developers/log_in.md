Next, choose the credentials you want use to sign in to Frontiers. 

If this is your first time logging in, you'll be promted to sign in with GitHub. You won't be able to continue using Frontiers' features until your GitHub account is linked.

Once you've signed in and connected your GitHub, you'll be taken to the homepage. As an admin, you should see a table displaying your current student courses (and staff courses, if applicable) on Frontiers. You should also be able to see an **Admin** dropdown on the top bar.

If you are on your personal deployment and do not have admin permissions, make sure your .env file is properly set up and that your email is included in ADMIN_EMAILS. If you haven’t set up a .env file yet, create one based on .env.SAMPLE.
