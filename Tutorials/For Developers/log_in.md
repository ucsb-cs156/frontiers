Once you've signed in and connected your GitHub, you'll be taken to the homepage. As an admin, you should see a table displaying your current student and instructor courses (and staff courses, if applicable) on Frontiers. You should also be able to see an **Admin** dropdown on the top bar.

**If you are on your personal deployment and do not have admin permissions, make sure your .env file is properly set up and that your email is included in ADMIN_EMAILS. If you haven’t set up a .env file yet, create one based on .env.SAMPLE.**
