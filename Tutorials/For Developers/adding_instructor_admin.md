## Tutorial
**If you are on your personal deployment and do not have admin permissions, make sure your .env file is properly set up and that your email is included in ADMIN_EMAILS. If you haven’t set up a .env file yet, create one based on .env.SAMPLE.**

To add an admin user through Frontiers, click the **Admin** dropdown in the top bar and select **Admins**. On this page, you can add a new admin user by clicking the **New Admin** button in the top-right corner. Only admin users created through the Frontiers application can be deleted within Frontiers.
