## Tutorial

If this is your first time logging in, you'll be promted to sign in with GitHub. You won't be able to continue using Frontiers' features until your GitHub account is linked.

Once you've signed in and connected your GitHub, you'll be taken to the homepage. As a student, you should see a table displaying your current courses on Frontiers. 

If the status of your course is _Pending_, it means your instructor has not yet completed the course setup on Frontiers. Once the setup is finished, the status will change to a **Join Now** button.
