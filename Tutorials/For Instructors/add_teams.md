To add an individual team, click **Add Individual Team**. A modal will appear prompting you to enter the team name. Fill out the form and submit it to add the team. Team members can be manually added by clicking the **Add Team Member** button and selecting the student from the dropdown. **Only students who have already been added to the course can be assigned to teams (see the _Adding Students_ article for more information).**
