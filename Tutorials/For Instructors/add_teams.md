## Tutorial
Frontiers allows you to add teams individually or through a roster upload. To access the **Teams** page, click the course name in your insturctor courses table, then navigate to the **Teams** tab. 


To add an individual team, click **Add Individual Team**. A modal will appear prompting you to enter the team name. Fill out the form and submit it to add the team. Team members can be manually added by clicking the **Add Team Member** button and selecting the student from the dropdown. Only students who have already been added to the course can be assigned to teams (see the _Adding Students_ article for more information). 

To add team using a roster, click **Upload Teams by CSV** and upload your CSV file. For details on the required CSV format, open the  **Help** dropdown in the top-right corner next to the **Log Out** button and select **CSV Upload/Download Formats**.
