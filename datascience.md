# {{page.title}}

CMPSC 5A at UCSB is based on Data 8 from UC Berkeley, which uses a specfic Python library called `datascience`.

That library is *not* part of the usual PrairieLearn (PL) python environment, 
so when you do `import datascience` in a regular question in PL, you typically get
an error message *unless* you are using a specific external grader.
